      <p>
        Since 1962 World Theatre Day has been celebrated by ITI Centres, ITI Cooperating Members, theatre professionals,
        theatre organizations, theatre universities and theatre lovers all over the world on the 27th of March. This day
        is a celebration for those who can see the value and importance of the art form “theatre”, and acts as a
        wake-up-call for governments, politicians and institutions which have not yet recognised its value to the people
        and to the individual and have not yet realised its potential for economic growth.
